    ```

    Start the development Express server

    ```sh
    npm run dev:server
    ```

    Start the development ReactJs Application

    ```sh
    npm run dev:app
    ```

    Server will be running on `https://localhost:3000`

    App will be running on `http://localhost:5173`

    Generate prisma client

    ```sh
    npm run db:generate
    ```

    Migrate Database schmema

    ```sh
    npm run db:migrate
    ```

    Start the Express server
